## ðŸš€ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Elias-Solo/Network-Monitoring-Dashboard.git
    cd Network-Monitoring-Dashboard
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    After navigating into the project directory, install the necessary Python dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the script**:
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the dashboard script with:
    ```bash
    python network_dashboard.py
    ```

    This will start the network monitoring dashboard. Make sure the `python` command refers to Python 3 on your system (it might be `python3` instead of `python` on some systems).
